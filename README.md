# AI Visuals in Power BI
This repository showcases my exploration of AI-powered visuals in Power BI. It includes examples of using built-in AI visuals, like Key Influencers and Decomposition Trees, to analyze and visualize data in more insightful ways.
**AI-driven features in Power BI**:
- **Key Influencers**: Identifies the factors that influence a selected metric or data point, helping to understand what drives your key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Decomposition Tree**: Allows for data breakdown to analyze complex metrics by multiple dimensions and drill down into details dynamically.
- **Q&A Visual**: Enables users to ask natural language questions about the data and receive instant visual answers.

## Key Visuals

### 1. Key Influencers
- The **Key Influencers** visual is used to analyze `house sale price` data. It highlights the top 10 features that influence house sale prices. 
- This helps to understand which factors most significantly drive up the sale price of homes.

### 2. Decomposition Tree
The **Decomposition Tree** visual analyzes total sales using `AdventureWorksDW2019` data. It breaks down total sales across various features, such as region, reseller, product category, employee, supervisor, and more. This visual allows for:
- A step-by-step exploration of how different factors contribute to total sales.
- Dynamic interaction by drilling down into specific features for a detailed analysis.
- A clear view of which dimensions have the most significant impact on sales performance.

### 3. Q&A Visual
The **Q&A** feature empowers users to:

- Ask questions in plain English (or other supported languages).
- Receive immediate answers in the form of relevant visuals.
- Easily adjust the visuals for further customization.

## How to Use the Dashboard

- **Interact with Key Influencers**: Select a target metric and explore which factors have the most significant impact.
- **Decompose Data**: Use the decomposition tree to drill down through different dimensions to uncover more granular insights.
- **Ask Questions**: Type questions directly into the Q&A visual, and Power BI will respond with charts or tables that best answer your query.


## Conclusion

In this project, I explored the use of AI visuals in Power BI, including Key Influencers, Decomposition Trees, and Q&A. By applying these features to house sale price data and the AdventureWorks dataset, I learned how these tools can help break down and analyze data in new ways.
